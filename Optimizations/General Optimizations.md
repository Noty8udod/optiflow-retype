Please note that if you're using a SSD, defragmentation is not necessary and is typically not recommended because SSDs have a different method of storing data and don't benefit from defragmentation like traditional hard drives do. The "Optimize" function in modern Windows versions is smart enough to perform the correct optimization action for the type of drive you have.
